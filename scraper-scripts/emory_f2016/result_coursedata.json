We will also consider what citizenship means in different parts of the world and what it has meant at different historical times and places.  The course will be framed by these questions: Who belongs, who doesn't...and why? More importantly, how has the story of citizenship and belonging been told? With this background in mind, during the second half of the course we will explore the comparative -- historical and cross-cultural -- context for citizenship in the Hispanic world. More specifically, we will be looking at how citizenship, understood broadly as belonging to and participating in a civic community, has been defined in medieval Spain, colonial Spanish America, and the US borderlands from the early twentieth century to the present in hopes that this understanding might better inform highly charged discussions related to citizenship in the US today.\nAll students enrolled in this course will participate in engaged learning activities throughout the semester.

Topics include American settlement and growth, institutions, democratic culture, immigration, and the revolution in communications and information that set the stage for the world of today. The aim of this course is to give a primer on the broad trends and events in early US history, one that will hopefully equip students to start thinking about the connections between the distant American past and the course of American history ever since.

Some estimate that we see as many as 5000 ads every day. Yet we rarely take the time to analyze the ways these ubiquitous ads affect us, as individuals and as a society. This course will do just that.\nWe will examine advertising in American culture through a number of lenses. We will begin with an historical analysis\u2014how did advertising grow from a relatively small industry to the powerhouse it is today? We will analyze advertisements as texts\u2014how does advertising convey its messages in both overt and covert ways? How do ads indicate the cultural norms and attitudes of society? We will examine the ways advertising influences and produces our consumer culture, and we will discuss the affects advertising has on cultural change\u2014does it act as a progressive or a conservative force? We will also explore current discontent with consumer culture and recent attempts to disrupt the persuasive force of advertising. Overall, the course will provide an introduction to the critical study of advertising and its role in creating and sustaining cultural attitudes and ideologies.\n  Text: Turow, Joseph and Matthew P.

Humanitarian projects in Africa have taken many forms, from delivering food, shelter, clothing, or other basic needs to people in crisis; to providing medical and psychological services; to offering military protection.

And of equal import, what is the nature of their obligation to do so?\nAnd finally, how do diverse groups of people living in African contexts today understand, participate in, and experience humanitarian projects and their many contradictions?\n  This course provides students with a set of conceptual tools and lenses to analyze the discourse and practice of humanitarian aid in Africa. Themes to be explored critically in relation to humanitarianism include: colonialism, postcolonialism, and neo-colonialism; gender and generation; violence and suffering; ethics; media; representations of Africa; neoliberalism; and the politics of global health. Course materials will include historical accounts, ethnographic texts, theoretical articles from anthropology and history, film, news media articles, and political commentaries.\n   ", "topic": "Politic/Humanitarianism/Africa", "schedule": [{"time": "2:30pm - 3:45pm", "days": "TuTh", "instructor": "Phillips, Kristin"}], "notes": "Appropriate for First Year students.", "ger": "FSEM"}, {"name": "ANT200-000: Foundations of Behavior", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "none", "Grading": "none", "Related Courses": "NBB201-000", "credit": "3", "opus_number": "1403", "Descriptions": "This course presents an introduction to evolutionary processes and biological bases of behavior.

Lectures and readings will be organized around a developmental and life history perspective and will emphasize the importance of context in biological mechanisms and the interaction of social life, behavior, emotion, and cognition. Examples drawn especially from humans and nonhuman primates will be used to place human behavior in the context of other species and to illustrate the dual inheritance of biology and culture in our species.

A main learning goal of the course is to understand how to think in an integrative way about all the causes of behavior, from the ultimate causes in evolution to the proximate causes in the brain, hormones, and the environment, mediated by genetic and developmental causes in between. Like a foreign language, a biological science cannot be learned without memorizing vocabulary and basic principles. This course will enable students to master the basic vocabulary and principles of evolution, behavioral science, genetics, development, and brain science.\n  FAIR WARNING: Some students feel that studying evolution challenges their religious beliefs. This does not need to happen. You are not being asked to convert to a new faith, just to master a new science. No one will ask you to declare faith in it, but you will be required to know its facts and principles.\nCourse Requirements and Evaluation: Three multiple-choice/true-false examinations.

The course will address concepts such as the interrelationships in ourselves and our ancestors between diet, demography, sociality, bio-cultural evolution, and what makes humans unique in the natural world. It will also examine how methods such as paleoanthropological fieldwork, skeletal identification, and genetic modelling are implemented within biological anthropology. Along the way we explore the role of nutrition and dietary preferences in human evolution, the biological basis for modern human behavior, and the transition to modern lifestyles. Armed with this deeper understanding of human variation, we will examine critical and often controversial topics such as biological insights into diet and health, race and racism, sexual behavior, stress, cooperation, and violence.

Despite its importance, sleep has been the most stubbornly inexplicable of all basic biological functions. Moreover, millions of Americans use medication for sleep difficulties. Why? Perhaps our assumptions about sleep have led to asking the wrong questions, and to looking for answers in the wrong places. Moreover, sleep research has not investigated the wide range of sleep practices that exist around the world, and represents only a very narrow slice of human diversity. This course will draw upon anthropological, evolutionary, physiological, sociological, and epidemiological material to assemble a comprehensive, inclusive view of sleep. It tackles a series of perplexing paradoxes about sleep and explores how questioning established assumptions and integrating new data from non-western societies can lead to surprising insights and raise exciting questions about what sleep is and does, and how the ways we sleep affect us.\n  Texts:  Readings and other course materials will be posted on BlackBoard.  \n  Particulars:  Prerequisite \u2013 basic anthropology (101, 201, 202, or 210) and solid background in biology highly desirable.

We will seek to understand what food insecurity is, how it is defined and measured, how it is experienced by people in different settings, what causes it, and what the consequences are for human health and wellbeing (and for environment). We will achieve these goals through a mixture of lectures, debates, presentations, data analysis exercises, readings, and discussion. In addition to learning about food insecurity generally, during the latter portion of the course, we will focus our attention on the global food crises of 2008 and 2010, and seek to understand why these crises happened, what the consequences were, and whether we can expect more in the near future. We will also study the current state of evidence about the possible impacts of climate change on food security. Secondary goals for the class are for 1) students to gain skills and practice in designing and executing public presentations and 2) for students to gain skills and practice collecting and analyzing data related to food security.\n  Course Readings\nThere are required texts for the course. We will read Enough: Why the world\u2019s poorest starve in an age of plenty by Thurow and Kilman and we will read The Economic of Food by Westhoff.\n  We will also read a large number of shorter articles, essays, and chapters. These readings come from a diverse array of academic disciplines including anthropology, biology, economics, environmental history, geography, nutrition and political science.\n ", "topic": "Food Insecurity", "schedule": [{"time": "1:00pm - 2:15pm", "days": "TuTh", "instructor": "Hadley, Craig"}], "notes": "", "ger": ""}, {"name": "ANT385-002: Special Topics: Anthropology", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "none", "Grading": "none", "notes": "", "credit": "3", "opus_number": "1453", "Descriptions": "(May be repeated for credit when topic varies.)

The mixing of the two is sometimes even regarded as unsavory; think, for example, of mega-church leaders praying and fasting to reach donation quotas, fundraising campaigns to support religiously based social policies, or global financial networks that support religiously inspired extremist movements. However, economic and religious activities come together in much more ordinary and everyday aspects of life as well: publication and distribution of religious media, advertising campaigns to promote religious establishments and events, and religious prescriptions and proscriptions concerning consumer goods are all examples.\nThis dialectic relationship between religion and economics has long been recognized in anthropology and has served as a productive field for both empirical investigation and theory building. Some of the topics explored in this course include: the role of religion in the development of modern capitalism, the logic of gift exchange, religious and magical responses to the expansion of markets, theories of value and commodity, and religious rules of consumption. Readings will range from classic theorists such as Smith, Marx, and Weber to more recent anthropological thinkers such as Bourdieu, Comaroff and Comaroff, and Appadurai.

In exploring these topics we will draw upon some of the more important theoretical perspectives that have been developed in the cross-cultural study of law and power, especially those associated with Marx, Durkheim, Weber, and Foucault. These perspectives will be brought to bear on a number of related phenomena: patterns of dispute management; the cultural logic of judicial process; the role of law and discipline in reproducing and transforming systems of inequality defined in terms of gender, race, and class; the options available to people when the courts and other legal institutions that have jurisdiction over them fail to protect their rights and interests; and selected aspects of fear, panic, crime, and punishment in the new millennium. With respect to case studies and areal focus, the introductory sections of the course deal with law and order in stateless societies; most of the remainder of the course focuses on the West (especially the U.S. and France), and the Muslim world (particularly Malaysia).\n   ", "ger": "HSC", "schedule": [{"time": "2:30pm - 3:45pm", "days": "TuTh", "instructor": "Peletz, Michael"}], "Related Courses": "none", "topic": "none"}, {"name": "ANT497R-00P: Undergraduate Research", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "none", "Grading": "none", "notes": "", "credit": "1", "opus_number": "5758", "Descriptions": "Credit, one to four hours.

In conventional terms, an artistic medium is a vehicle of expression (e.g. painting and sculpture) as well as its attendant materials (e.g. oil paint and stone). Although traditional means and materials remain relevant in the postwar era, they nevertheless are reimagined or supplemented with other, new media in the art of this period. Some postwar artists expand the modes of artistic expression to include techniques of mass production and industrial fabrication while others, in the wake of technological innovations and social upheaval, turn to more intimate practices that focus on the body or the meticulously handcrafted. From the debates surrounding medium-specificity to trans-disciplinary methods of performance art, video art, and conceptual art, we will explore how the medium in postwar art ultimately becomes a multivalent concept, one that is as immaterial as it material.

Freshmen only. Variable topics.\nThis course is for Freshmen only.\nThe theory of evolution by natural selection sheds light on the emergence of the biological patterns we see around us and the behavior among them.  In recent decades, more and more theories try to explain human behavior using evolutionary concepts.  These range from dietary preference to mate choice, sparking up popular interest as well as controversy among scientists.  Can everything be explained by natural selection?  Are men and women fundamentally different in their cognitive faculties?  Did people of different ethnicities evolve different strengths?  Does infidelity really lurk in our genes and do babies really cry at night to avoid having siblings? \nIn this seminar, we will approach these questions and others by exploring different evolutionary approaches to human behavior, looking at theories and at the experiments trying to validate them.  We will discuss the importance of such theories, as well as the ethical issues that may arise, and engage in the tough task of separating the science from the \"just-so\" stories.\nText:  Selected readings.\nPrerequisites:  None.", "ger": "FSEM", "schedule": [{"time": "1:00pm - 2:15pm", "days": "TuTh", "instructor": "Arbilly, Michal"}], "Related Courses": "none", "topic": "Evolution of Human Behavior"}, {"name": "BIOL190-001: Freshman Seminar:Biology", "Grading": "none", "notes": "Appropriate for First Year students.", "credit": "3", "opus_number": "2402", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "Paul de KruifMicrobe Hunters\nISBN978156027779\nM.L.

But this is not right.  Knowledge is dead.\"  He also said:  \"On the contrary, the aim must be the training of independent acting and thinking individuals who see in the service of the community their highest life problem.\"\nIn this class, we try to develop \"independent thinking\" by considering various influences of possible gene actions on our daily life.  A gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity.  Genes change through time by accumulating various mutations and create different forms.  During evolution, mutations have created an amazing number of microbial, animal, and plant species, which include different human races.  In the short run, chemicals and other mutagens in our environments can increase the occurrence of mutations and increase our chance of contracting various illnesses.  In addition, because of a rapidly advancing DNA sequencing technology, our genomes can be read very quickly and this information may be used by others.  Therefore, we encounter potential problems related to genetic differences among us that influence such issues as health care, insurance policy, patent application, environmental policy, and racial issues.  Students are encouraged to think about these complex problems and their ramifications from different angles and to read published materials critically.\nNo textbooks are required.\nPrerequisites:  None.", "ger": "FSEM", "schedule": [{"time": "4:00pm - 5:15pm", "days": "TuTh", "instructor": "Yokoyama, Shozo"}], "Related Courses": "none", "topic": "Genes and Society"}, {"name": "BIOL200-000: Intro to Bio Research", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "none", "Grading": "none", "notes": "", "credit": "2", "opus_number": "2551", "Descriptions": "This 2-credit hour course may be taken as elective credit but DOES NOT fulfill the upper-level laboratory requirement for the Biology major.\nWorking in a research lab?

This 2-credit hour seminar course for freshmen, sophomores, and transfer students supports and enhances your independent research experience.  Advanced students may take it alongside independent research credits in a science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) field, and have an experience that is tailored to your interests and goals.\nThe main objective/purpose of this class is to prepare biology majors for a future laboratory or field research experience as a participant in SURE (Summer Undergraduate Research Experience), SIRE (Scholarly Inquiry and Research Experience), Biology 499R (Undergraduate Research) or other research options.  This course will also be useful for other students desiring an overview of the scientific research processes as well as for students planning to enter a graduate program at some future date.\nIn this course, students will be introduced to the scientific research process and to all of the basic tools they will need to become successful researchers.  Much of the emphasis wil be on using scientific literature, planning a research project (including experimental design and statistical design), preparation of a proposal, and scientific writing/rewriting.

Additionally, this course is required for all students seeking to apply for the fellowship in Community Building and Social Change.\nThis is a course about community building and social change in urban America. Community Building refers to \"locally focused approaches to collective problem-solving that aim to solve problems and to promote socially valuable forms of connectedness, sustained stakeholder engagement, a sense of common purpose, and greater institutional capacity.\" Social Change refers to the positive externalities (i.e., good consequences) of community building that broaden the access of disadvantaged communities to social, economic, and political opportunities. The course addresses a number of tensions and issues that affect community building, and the processes through which community builders attempt to foster social change in and around cities in the United States. It approaches the tensions and issues through a mix of theoretically-informed lectures, individual and group exercises, and the examination of a variety of case studies of contemporary community building initiatives through texts, film, and on occasion audio. The course is lecture-based but includes a small set of opportunities for student dialogue in and beyond the classroom. Furthermore, students should not expect that a course on \"community building and social change\" either lacks theoretical rigor or is a course full of opinion-based discussion and field trips to \"the community.\"\nThe course has five goals:\n1. Introduce students to the theoretical consideration of and applied principles that support community building as an approach to addressing collective problems in metropolitan America, inclusive of cities and suburbs;\n2. Provide students with a set of theoretical and analytic perspectives for examining urban issues and fostering social change;\n3. Assist students in identifying the interconnections among demography, culture, economy, and polity, and the global, national, state, regional, and neighborhood forces affecting metropolitan communities;\n4. Lay a foundation for students to eventually engage in analysis, reflection, and application of the key determinants of successful community building initiatives and to understand the core competencies needed for successful community builders;\n5. Prepare interested students to apply for participation in Emory University's Community Building and Social Change Fellowship.\nIn the end, the hope is that this course will give students a solid understanding of the challenges, dynamics, and promise of metropolitan communities (i.e., urban and suburban), along with an appreciation for the complexity and opportunities of fostering social change. Together, these elements should ensure that students have a breadth of knowledge about community building that will permit them to confidently explore and deeply engage more complex issues at and beyond Emory University.\nClass Section Homepage: http://www.oucp.emory.edu/our_work/engaged_learning/cbsc_index.html#community building social change\nTexts:\nTBD", "topic": "none", "schedule": [{"time": "9:00am - 9:50am", "days": "MWF", "instructor": "Rich, Michael"}], "notes": "", "ger": "HSC"}, {"name": "CHEM105-000: How Things Work", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "none", "Grading": "none", "notes": "Appropriate for First Year students.", "credit": "3", "opus_number": "1594", "Descriptions": "No prerequisite courses.

First we acquire a qualitative understanding of Molecular Orbital Theory, which we use to readily predict the structure and reactivity of all organic molecules. We can then concentrate on the structural aspects of stereochemistry. With this background we can begin to apply these two new encompassing principles to learn the reactions of different classes of organic compounds. A mechanistic approach allows us to answer \"why\" these reactions proceed as they do. Finally, Organic Chemistry is not a subject confined to the lecture room.

A historical approach, however, allows us to get a sense for how human relationships to food in East Asia have changed dramatically over time, even as certain ideas of food continue to resonate. People the world over encounter East Asian cultures for the first time through food, but what exactly constitutes Asian food? Let alone Chinese, Japanese, or Korean foods? How do we define its parameters, or explain its cultural, historical, and social significance? In this course, we will explore and interrogate different ways in which to imagine, understand, and define East Asian foods. We will examine the shifting relationships between people, food, and the environment and ask: How have distance and space between the sites of production and consumption affected the economic and social relations of food? How has geography influenced the types of food people eat? What are the agricultural roots of East Asian foods? What role have governments and markets played in regional agriculture and regional food cultures? How does food refract and transform social divisions, cultural attitudes, and daily life? How have people celebrated food and drink, through poetry or nostalgic imagination? How has food followed East Asian migrants around the world, and how has it been adapted to local contexts?

In our course, we will reconsider this philosophical distinction between the human and the animal. Not only will we consider how the concept of the animal has been formulated within the discipline of philosophy, but we will also consider how the discipline of philosophy itself has been founded on the conceptual containment of the animal. Our course thus broaches the following question: Is it possible to think about the animal philosophically, or does the animal expose the very limits of philosophical thought?\nThis course is divided into two parts. The first part of our course will focus on the discourse of \u201canimal liberation\u201d within Anglo-American philosophy. Our assigned readings will cover the full text of Peter Singer\u2019s Animal Liberation. The second part of our course will focus on the discourse of \u201canti-humanism\u201d within Continental philosophy.

To answer this question, we will analyze this legendary trial from every angle through close readings of the primary ancient sources \u2013 the works of Plato, Xenophon, Aristophanes and the Sophists. And we will learn how to analyze them by reading Aristotle\u2019s account of the art of rhetoric: rhetoric teaches us how to do things with words, how any discourse \u2013 philosophical, legal, political, literary, dramatic, cinematic, commercial or pornographic \u2013 acts upon our minds; how it succeeds or fails, as well as what it says. Students will learn how to read and explicate these very different ancient texts in their original contexts and how to assess their value for contemporary audiences. If time allows we will compare the rhetorical strategies of actual trials (e.g. Socrates\u2019) to those of literary trials (e.g. Shakespeare\u2019s Merchant of Venice). The seminar will conclude with each student defending their vote to acquit or convict Socrates of the original charges.

The theater often plays a similar task of marking the transition of the society from one form to another. For instance, the Greek tragedy Antigone, which we will read in the class, is often understood to commemorate the transition from a society built around the family to one under the power and influence of a government and civic culture.\nThis class will pay special attention to these symbolic activities in which the community performs \u201csocial alchemy\u201d: the ability to transform its members or its very own status and functioning. We will analyze theatrical practices and religious ceremonies from different cultures and time periods not only to better understand how cultures produce meaning through ritual and myth but also to recognize that these same practices enforce power relations and the economic functioning of the group. We will look largely at the Greek, Roman, and Medieval Christian worlds.\nTraversing a variety roles from childhood to old age, we do not remain fixed to certain social identities much like our forebearers in the ancient and medieval worlds. Societies have conceived a variety of ways to give form, structure, and meaning to the changes that occur in our individual and communal lives. Whether this mutability is conceived of in positive terms (fluidity or becoming) or in negative terms (instability or loss), myth and ritual regulate and make intelligible the confusing fact that the individual and the community are not one but many, constantly changing under both internal and external pressures. Our class will take seriously the role of ritual and myth and producing and sustaining the various communities that we share.\nPrimary texts will include selections from Sophocles, Euripides, The Bible, Plato, mystery plays, and contemporary accounts of the rituals and social practices of the ancient and medieval world.

To understand these cultural phenomena we have to think about the production of culture and its relation to capital. As capital markets expanded during the early modern period, new technologies and social developments meant that culture began to take on different forms. Newly literate populations participated in emerging political discourses while new financial instruments and commodities connected people through their investments and expenditures.\nIn this course we explore cultural forms as varied as stock-price bubbles, an account of a cat massacre, and ritual jokes, treating them as texts which require close reading and interpretation. We will compare them to more familiar kinds of literature, including plays, diaries and memoirs. In examining the pieces together, we ask what separates popular culture from the \u201cbeaux-arts\u201d or popular practices from distinguished ones. Accordingly, we will rely on theoretical concepts such as symbolic capital, superstructure and the author-function.\nThe course assignments consist of short weekly responses (1 page) and two papers (8-10 pages each), one of which is a critical review of an assigned text and the other an analysis of an object of popular culture.

By themselves, each of these texts exercise their right to interrupt the discourse of tradition by positing (or aiming for) a new beginning.

This seminar explores the mobilization of older literary forms and values (including the chivalric \u201cromances\u201d of the middle ages) in a range of texts responding to revolutionary events in Europe between 1790 and 1852. Whether written from a revolutionary or reactionary perspective, responses to the upheavals of the era typically turn to the past not only to understand but to intervene in the revolutionary project. The effects of these interventions are not always easy to predict: on the one hand, conservative nostalgia for a \u2018romanticized\u2019 pre-revolutionary era sometimes produces texts that show a modernizing historical consciousness; on the other, revolutionary attempts to break with the past repeatedly have recourse to figuration and forms drawn from it in ways that seem to undermine their own  revolutionary project. We will look at a variety of literary genres to explore how these dynamics suggest shifting ways of thinking about the intertwining of history, literature, and revolution.

Marx exposed the relation between ideas and their material origins; Nietzsche called the very idea of truth into question; and Freud suggested that human existence itself rests on dark and unexamined foundations. The founders, both consciously and unwittingly, of movements that attempted to use their insights to transform politics and culture, these intellectual revolutionaries changed the landscape of modern life. In this course, we will focus not only on understanding their ideas and methods but also on learning how to deploy them ourselves.\nAs critical thinkers committed to extending the power of self-reflection into new regions, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud were the inheritors and extenders of the enlightenment. But all three were also highly aware of the power of the irrational to shape human existence. The tension between rationality and irrationality is at the heart of the distinctive new ways of thinking associated with their names. This course will closely examine the ideas of each of these \u201cmasters\u201d of argument: we will study each on his own terms, engaging in careful and critical readings of major works. We will also practice using the paradigms they developed by reading a major literary work from Marxian, Nietzschean, and Freudian perspectives.

A historical approach, however, allows us to get a sense for how human relationships to food in East Asia have changed dramatically over time, even as certain ideas of food continue to resonate. People the world over encounter East Asian cultures for the first time through food, but what exactly constitutes Asian food? Let alone Chinese, Japanese, or Korean foods? How do we define its parameters, or explain its cultural, historical, and social significance? In this course, we will explore and interrogate different ways in which to imagine, understand, and define East Asian foods. We will examine the shifting relationships between people, food, and the environment and ask: How have distance and space between the sites of production and consumption affected the economic and social relations of food? How has geography influenced the types of food people eat? What are the agricultural roots of East Asian foods? What role have governments and markets played in regional agriculture and regional food cultures? How does food refract and transform social divisions, cultural attitudes, and daily life? How have people celebrated food and drink, through poetry or nostalgic imagination? How has food followed East Asian migrants around the world, and how has it been adapted to local contexts? What would we consider to be the state of Chinese, Korean, or Japanese food today, in their home countries and in transnational diasporas?", "topic": "none", "schedule": [{"time": "4:00pm - 7:00pm", "days": "W", "instructor": "Fu, Jia-Chen"}], "notes": "", "ger": ""}, {"name": "ECON101-000: Principles Of Microeconomics", "Grading": "none", "notes": "Appropriate for First Year students.", "credit": "3", "opus_number": "1477", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "Paul Krugman and Robin Wells2014Microeconomics\nISBN9781464143878\nPublisher: Worth Publishers; 4th edition", "Descriptions": "Prerequisite: none.

Topics covered include demand and supply in competitive markets, market power, game theory, externalities, and asymmetric information.\n  Textbooks: \nRequired:\nRobert Frank & Ben Bernanke\nPrinciples of Microeconomics\nISBN 9780073362663\nPublsher: McGraw-Hill 4th Edition\n  Grady Klein & Yoram Bauman\nThe Cartoon Introduction to Economics, Volume One: Microeconomics\nISBN 9780809094813\nPublisher: Hill & Wang 1st Edition\n  View Syllabus", "topic": "none", "schedule": [{"time": "11:30am - 12:45pm", "days": "MW", "instructor": "Mialon, Hugo"}], "Related Courses": "none", "ger": "HSC"}, {"name": "ECON101-002: Principles Of Microeconomics", "Grading": "none", "notes": "Appropriate for First Year students.", "credit": "3", "opus_number": "1479", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "Frank, Robert H., Ben S.

This course is a systematic and empirical journey through the economic, political and governance  landscapes of  Europe, Middle East and  North Africa through a comparative assessment of the evolution of  state institutions and markets. The course will find answers to three set of questions. The first set of questions is related to state building: how some institutions or the lack thereof led to mechanisms that produced freedom, prosperity and welfare arrangements or  exclusionary policies, poverty and authoritarianism. What kind of economic and political configurations enable citizens to develop more \u201ccapabilities\u201d to surf the complex waves of economic globalization. The second set of question question deals with the dramatic economic and political transformation, which the region experienced prior to, during and after  the \u201cArab Spring\u201d. How EMENA (Europe, Middle East and  North Africa) as an interconnected space through history, trade and migration, will evolve politically and economically in the future. How the increasing political instability with failing states like Libya and Iraq  will impact patterns of growth, economic integration, monetary policies and migration. The third set of with the  experienced a wave of liberalization over the past two decades. The course will evaluates development in the EMENA countries by examining case studies of  countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, GCC countries, Iran, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and the EU. As an example we study specific the free trade agreements. \nIn sum the course sheds light on broader questions of how social, political, and cultural behaviors inform economic outcomes.

In turn, the choices of others depend on the actions that we\ntake. Game theory offers a systematic and analytical framework to understand the optimal,\nstrategic decision in such an interactive situation. For this reason, game theory has been applied\nto many fields of social science such as economics and politics.\nThe goals of this course are to give you an introduction to strategic thinking and to show you\nhow to use the framework of game theory in understanding human behavior and answering\nreal-world economic questions. \nWe will focus on non-cooperative game theory and its applications.

Literary texts are saturated with discussions and descriptions of various states and forms of disease. Turning to literature for narratives of disease provides us with important insight into the human condition such as the meaning of health and healing, death and mortality, disabled and non-disabled bodies. In this writing course we will use literature and the theme of pathology in print to guide us as we learn about writing, create our own theory of writing, and compose our own texts.

The texts you will use as you develop as writers include short stories by Flannery O\u2019Connor and Ernest Hemingway, excerpts from novels like A Confederacy of Dunces and As I Lay Dying, and, most importantly, texts you and your peers compose.

Literature has always been a place where questions like these have been thought aloud. Whether the borders are geographical or metaphorical, whether they keep people out or fence people in, borders are liminal spaces that raise questions about politics, oppression, belongingness, identity, among others, and that makes them an important subject for our interrogation.\nThis writing intensive class will thus explore two types of borders.

Games are products of a complicated network of social, economic, and technological forces and as such they are dense objects, deeply layered with multiple meanings and hidden histories that reveal much about our cultural values, hopes and anxieties, and assumptions about the world. We will consider questions such as how games are designed and manufactured, who plays them and where, and in what ways videogames can be more than entertainment. \nAs a class, we\u2019ll play through some fairly recent \u201cart\u201d or \u201cindie\u201d games like Gone Home, The Beginner\u2019s Guide, and The Stanley Parable.

The course will be divided into two parts: the first part will focus on the fundamental terms of poetic criticism, equipping students with the vocabulary necessary for sound formal analysis. The second and more substantial part of the course will focus upon modern and contemporary poetry, ranging from the early 20th century to the present day. Some of the question we will consider include: How was modernist poetry\u2019s formal and linguistic innovation empowering and how was it limiting? How do poets from marginalized groups engage with, negotiate, or subvert the universalism and aestheticism typical of modernist poetics? Is post-modern poetry a development of modernist poetry or a departure from it? \nThe main text for the class will be the two-volume Norton Anthology of Modern and Contemporary Poetry.

You will learn reading strategies to help you understand the \u201chow\u201d and make you more confident readers of poetry. At the same time, we\u2019ll look at what poetry does\u2014how it responds to the poets\u2019 world, how it resonates with readers beyond its own context, what it might change or affect. Drawing on a wide range of primarily contemporary texts, we will focus on poetry that responds, reacts, intervenes in, and generally engages with politic, social, ecological, and personal crises. This will include poems that respond to anything from armed conflicts to cancer, from climate change to racial and economic injustice. We\u2019ll discuss how poetic interventions are similar to other art forms, and what makes poetry distinct. You will come away from this class with a greater understanding\u2014and enjoyment\u2014of poetry, as well as a sense of how it functions in the broader cultural landscape in which we live.\nIn this course, you will have the opportunity to sharpen your critical reading skills by writing frequent blog posts, and several short essays.

Marx exposed the relation between ideas and their material origins; Nietzsche called the very idea of truth into question; and Freud suggested that human existence itself rests on dark and unexamined foundations. The founders, both consciously and unwittingly, of movements that attempted to use their insights to transform politics and culture, these intellectual revolutionaries changed the landscape of modern life. In this course, we will focus not only on understanding their ideas and methods but also on learning how to deploy them ourselves.\nAs critical thinkers committed to extending the power of self-reflection into new regions, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud were the inheritors and extenders of the enlightenment. But all three were also highly aware of the power of the irrational to shape human existence. The tension between rationality and irrationality is at the heart of the distinctive new ways of thinking associated with their names. This course will closely examine the ideas of each of these \u201cmasters\u201d of argument: we will study each on his own terms, engaging in careful and critical readings of major works. We will also practice using the paradigms they developed by reading a major literary work from Marxian, Nietzschean, and Freudian perspectives.

This seminar explores the mobilization of older literary forms and values (including the chivalric \u201cromances\u201d of the middle ages) in a range of texts responding to revolutionary events in Europe between 1790 and 1852. Whether written from a revolutionary or reactionary perspective, responses to the upheavals of the era typically turn to the past not only to understand but to intervene in the revolutionary project. The effects of these interventions are not always easy to predict: on the one hand, conservative nostalgia for a \u2018romanticized\u2019 pre-revolutionary era sometimes produces texts that show a modernizing historical consciousness; on the other, revolutionary attempts to break with the past repeatedly have recourse to figuration and forms drawn from it in ways that seem to undermine their own  revolutionary project. We will look at a variety of literary genres to explore how these dynamics suggest shifting ways of thinking about the intertwining of history, literature, and revolution.

Paying attention to British novels from across the century, this course will examine stories about the transformation of the self within this rapidly transforming world. We will ask: what does the coming of age novel look like in age where, as Yeats put it, \u201cthe centre cannot hold,\u201d and old wisdom may no longer apply? What kinds of knowledge and education are available to youthful protagonists in modernist fiction? How do the experiences of love and passion, disappointment and displacement, contribute the narrative of development? What is the relationship between the modern novel and developmental psychology? And what modes of belonging might be achievable in a more pluralistic and diverse nation?\nParticularly in the early part of the course, we\u2019ll have the opportunity to explore the development of authors as well as protagonists, since we\u2019ll be reading novels from early in the careers of Conrad, Woolf, Lawrence, and Forster: what kinds of experimentation lead an author to the discovery of a \u201cmature\u201d style?

In this advanced course, students will study and write in a range of forms, from the manifesto to the three-line novel, from sonnets to erasures, the prose poem and the lyrical essay, in order to discover new paths in reading and writing.

Additionally, this course is required for all students seeking to apply for the fellowship in Community Building and Social Change.\nThis is a course about community building and social change in urban America. Community Building refers to \"locally focused approaches to collective problem-solving that aim to solve problems and to promote socially valuable forms of connectedness, sustained stakeholder engagement, a sense of common purpose, and greater institutional capacity.\" Social Change refers to the positive externalities (i.e., good consequences) of community building that broaden the access of disadvantaged communities to social, economic, and political opportunities. The course addresses a number of tensions and issues that affect community building, and the processes through which community builders attempt to foster social change in and around cities in the United States. It approaches the tensions and issues through a mix of theoretically-informed lectures, individual and group exercises, and the examination of a variety of case studies of contemporary community building initiatives through texts, film, and on occasion audio. The course is lecture-based but includes a small set of opportunities for student dialogue in and beyond the classroom. Furthermore, students should not expect that a course on \"community building and social change\" either lacks theoretical rigor or is a course full of opinion-based discussion and field trips to \"the community.\"\nThe course has five goals:\n1. Introduce students to the theoretical consideration of and applied principles that support community building as an approach to addressing collective problems in metropolitan America, inclusive of cities and suburbs;\n2. Provide students with a set of theoretical and analytic perspectives for examining urban issues and fostering social change;\n3. Assist students in identifying the interconnections among demography, culture, economy, and polity, and the global, national, state, regional, and neighborhood forces affecting metropolitan communities;\n4. Lay a foundation for students to eventually engage in analysis, reflection, and application of the key determinants of successful community building initiatives and to understand the core competencies needed for successful community builders;\n5. Prepare interested students to apply for participation in Emory University's Community Building and Social Change Fellowship.\nIn the end, the hope is that this course will give students a solid understanding of the challenges, dynamics, and promise of metropolitan communities (i.e., urban and suburban), along with an appreciation for the complexity and opportunities of fostering social change. Together, these elements should ensure that students have a breadth of knowledge about community building that will permit them to confidently explore and deeply engage more complex issues at and beyond Emory University.\nClass Section Homepage: http://www.oucp.emory.edu/our_work/engaged_learning/cbsc_index.html#community building social change\nTexts:\nTBD", "topic": "none", "schedule": [{"time": "9:00am - 9:50am", "days": "MWF", "instructor": "Rich, Michael"}], "notes": "", "ger": "HSC"}, {"name": "ENVS385-000: Topics: Environmental Studies", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "none", "Grading": "none", "Related Courses": "ARTVIS333R-000\nFILM389-000", "credit": "3", "opus_number": "2189", "Descriptions": "Variable topics that are offered as irregular courses.

By retracing their elaboration it serves to highlight continuities and discontinuities in the historical development of French and Francophone literatures and cultures.\nCourse Description.\nSpanning from the 1755 Lisbon earthquake to the current refugee crisis, the course examines the function of literature, film, and memorials in the aftermath of Catastrophe. The course focuses on so-called \u201cnatural disasters\u201d and \u201chuman-made disasters,\u201d such as earthquake, war, and mass exile, which often lead to ecological and humanitarian crises. We will examine 1. How literary, filmic, and artistic production is shaped by catastrophe 2. How literary, filmic, and artistic production can provide understanding, rituals, and ideas for practical response in the aftermath of disaster. The literature studied in this course, while produced in French by authors from Haiti, France, or Cameroon, often has a worldwide scope and reach.\nParticulars:  Active class participation, 2 response papers (3-pages each with rewrite), 3 400-word Blackboard responses, 1 short oral presentation.

Yet, they do so from extremely divergent perspectives.\nWe will read Georg B\u00fcchner\u2019s, Woyzeck (1836), Richard Wagner\u2019s, Tristan und Isolde (1857), Hugo von Hofmannsthal\u2019s Der Rosenkavlier (1910), and Bertolt Brecht\u2019s Dreigroschenoper (1929), hear and see Alban Berg\u2019s Wozzeck (1925), Richard Wagner\u2019s Tristan und Isolde (1865), Richard Strauss\u2019 Der Rosenkavalier (1911), and Kurt Weill\u2019s Die Dreigroschenoper (1928).\nThese four operas also paradigmatically lend themselves for a host of topics and issues in regard to artistic productions in general:\nFirst, we encounter four different dramatic genres/modes: social realism, tragedy, comedy, and satire.\nSecond, all four texts show the manifold process and use of literary sources, or the degree of how texts need to be understood in dialogue with other texts, i.e., their nature as an intertextual expression. To this extent, each opera and libretto can also be viewed in dialogue with one another.\nThird, the web of references that the four operas shed on each other can also serve as a paradigm for understanding artistic productions not as isolated events but as a complex and interdependent web of reception.\nFourth, each opera stands for a very different process in how the literary text was viewed or rendered as a musical composition.\nLast but not least, each one of them appeals to inquire the various modes of production and performances.\nThis course reflects the discursive focus level IV of our curriculum, i.e., argumentation.

It is ideal for students who are interested in the region and would like some historical background. It is also an ideal gateway course for students who are considering majoring or minoring in East Asian Studies. \nProfessors Andrade and Ravina are both interested in global and transnational issues, focusing on how the East Asian international system interacted with Southeast Asia, South Asia, and Inner Asia, as well as with Europe and the US. By beginning in 1500 and including Japan and China's maritime empires, as well as the great expeditions of the Chinese explorer Zheng He, we will provide a historical context for East Asia's economic impact in the 21st century. In the mid-1600s China, Japan, and Korea all restricted overseas voyages, opening the way for European expansion into East Asia. Rather than see these policies as isolation or retreat, we will emphasize the continued dynamism of diplomacy and trade within East Asia, as well as the importance of East Asia in the world economy. In this way, we will move beyond the Western impact/Asian response dichotomy that continues to shape courses of this type. Similarly, we will examine East Asia's modernizing reforms of the 19th and 20th centuries from a transnational perspective. Reformers in Japan, China and Korea often copied European models of social and governmental organization, but they did so in an era when such models were being promoted as universal. Reformers in Japan, China and Korea debated whether these \"international\" norms were truly open and universal or were merely a cover for imperialism. The debate continues to this day, and we will again emphasize the historical context of current events, such as the increasingly dangerous clashes between East Asian powers over areas in the China Seas. \nRequired Textbooks\nJonathan Spence, The Search for Modern China, W.

Beginning with the late 1400s, Africans, Europeans, and Native Americans lay the foundations for a wide-ranging global system through the exchange of ideas, goods, and pathogens. This system, which we now call the Atlantic world, consisted mainly of the societies situated along the coasts of the Atlantic Ocean, but its reverberations reached far beyond. By the eighteenth century, the Atlantic world would provide the foundation for economic structures and ideologies that we have come to take for granted\u2014most notably global capitalism and liberal democracy. In this course, we will explore the making of this world through cross-cultural conflict, exchange, and accommodation. Topics include: geographic exploration and empire-building, slavery and captivity, imperial and trans-imperial trading networks, the African diaspora, and cross-cultural exchange (in fields such as medical, legal, and spiritual practice). Students will learn how to think historically about social phenomena that cut across imperial and (what would later become) national boundaries and will engage with a wide range of primary sources: travel accounts, judicial cases, personal diaries, slave narratives, legal cases, and early modern artwork. No prior knowledge or coursework is required.\nRequired textbooks:\nPernille Ipsen, Daughters of the Trade: Atlantic Slavers and Interracial Marriage on the Gold Coast (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2014), ISBN-13: 978-0812246735\nMaya Jasanoff, Liberty\u2019s Exiles: American Loyalists in the Revolutionary World (Vintage, 2012), ISBN-13: 978-1400075478\nMarcy Norton, Sacred Gifts, Profane Pleasures: A History of Tobacco and Chocolate in the Atlantic World (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008, pbbck 2010), ISBN-13: 978-0801476327\nJames Sweet, Domingos Alvares, African Healing, and the Intellectual History of the Atlantic World (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2014), ISBN-13: 978-1469609751\nJohn Thornton, A Cultural History of the Atlantic World, 1250-1820 (Cambridge University Press, 2012), ISBN-13: 978-0521727341\n ", "topic": "Globalization: Atlantic World", "schedule": [{"time": "10:00am - 11:15am", "days": "TuTh", "instructor": "Chira, Adriana"}], "notes": "Appropriate for First Year students.", "ger": "HSC"}, {"name": "HIST285-005: Topics: Historical Analysis", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "none", "Grading": "Assignment/Exam Details % of Total Grade\nTwo Papers (15%-25% each)\nClass Participation\nTwo Exams (25% each) A midterm and a final, in-class written exam involving identifications and essays.", "Related Courses": "AMST285-002", "credit": "3", "opus_number": "5681", "Descriptions": "An introductory course on the nature and methods of history. May be repeated for credit when topic varies.\nSome historians of postwar American history present us with a two-part story. At the end of World War II, they say, a period of consensus emerged in American politics as a shared commitment to anti-communism forced traditional political disagreements into the background. But by the mid-1960s, large scale changes were wrenching us apart. Suburbanization increased the physical and social distance between Americans. Minorities and women created political movements that challenged traditional social hierarchies. A costly war in Vietnam prompted large-scale dissent about the perils of communism. Rising violent crime rates and de-industrialization marked cities as dangerous, impoverished zones populated by a dangerous \u201cunderclass.\u201d The result was dissolution of the postwar consensus and polarization of the public along conservative and liberal lines.\nUsing the lens of popular culture, we will evaluate this narrative. How do scholarly writings, widely-circulated television broadcasts, fiction and nonfiction writings, musical recordings, and films lend credence to this story about American politics? How do they challenge or qualify this story? What other understandings of the postwar period do they suggest? Particular attention will be paid to the different ways we can read popular culture: as thinly-veiled propaganda that promotes dominant ideas and interests; as ammunition that dispossessed people can use to stake out a place for themselves in opposition to the powerful; and as opportunities for the development of new political ideas.\nAside from the following texts, all course materials will be available through Reserves Direct or on the course Blackboard site.

As such, it takes an interdisciplinary approach to answering the fundamental questions that have been debated for centuries: What is Russia? Where is Russia? Where is Russia going? Along the way, the course examines the essential components of Russia\u2019s national identity, as well as the question of how this identity has been understood by both the Russians themselves and by the other peoples of the region. These issues are approached from a number of perspectives, including historical, political, legal, economic, cultural and artistic. The class relies less on overarching textbook approaches and more on close readings of short and varied texts that illuminate Russia\u2019s past, present, and, hopefully, its future. Proceeding from the fixities of geography and climate, the course explores the weight of history, the power of the state, the constitution of culture, the importance of religion and art, and the exigencies of everyday life. The course highlights continuities in the historical experience while addressing the causes of powerful and violent ruptures in culture and society that, throughout history, have affected Russia itself, its neighbors, and the world at large. We hope that through thiscourse students will receive not simply an introduction to the fascinating riddle that is Russia, but also an understanding of the complexities and multiple interpretive approaches that should animate the study of any nation.\nRequired Textbook and Other Readings\nTEXTS:\nMichael L.

The Soviet Union experienced the worst casualties during the war and made the largest contribution to the defeat of Nazism. This class examines that story.\nThis course will examine the Soviet role in World War II. The USSR suffered far more causalities than any other belligerent nation as Soviet troops stopped the Nazi war machine in epic battles such as Barbarossa, Moscow, Stalingrad, the Siege of Leningrad, Kursk, Operation Bagration and the Battle of Berlin. But the story of the Great Patriotic War, as it is known by the Russians, is so much broader than the clash of arms. From the establishment of two violently opposed totalitarian dictatorships to the diplomatic maneuverings of a too crafty Stalin to the shock of invasion and total mobilization of Soviet people, even under a brutal German occupation, this is a story of people. The course will follow the war through the eyes of simple Soviet soldiers (\"Ivan the Terrible\" to their fascist foes), , brilliant writers and brutalized Gulag prisoners, victims of the holocaust and Red partisans, women snipers and the Generalissimo himself, Iosif Stalin. The course will focus on the Soviet experience, but of course the Nazi's motivations and actions will be studied, as will be the suspicious and competitive alliance with the Western allies. The Soviet victory on the Eastern Front was as unexpected as it was earth-shaking and came at an almost incalculable cost in human suffering and a brutally traumatized society. Three generations after the guns fell silent, Russians and other Soviet peoples are still recovering from the demographic catastrophe and the political legitimation of communism that came as a consequence of this, not only Russia's, but the world's largest war every fought. \nASSIGNED READINGS:  Aside from the following texts, all course materials will be available through Reserves Direct or on the course Blackboard site.

We will explore: how and why Jews migrated from Western to Eastern Europe in the middle ages; the Jewish-Noble economic symbiosis in early-modern Poland-Lithuania and the impact of the Chmielnicki Uprising of 1648-49; the messianic upheavals of Sabbatianism and Frankism; the development of Hasidism and its opponents; the 1772-1795 partitions of Poland and the creation of Russian Jewry; Russian Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) and changing attitudes towards religion and \u201cJewishness\u201d; the rise of mass politics and new forms of Jewish self-expression (nationalism, Zionism, socialism, Yiddishism); WWI, the Russian Revolution, and Bolshevism; inter-war Jewish life in independent Poland; the Holocaust in the Soviet Union; and the culture of memory about this lost world that has emerged in its aftermath. This course will make extensive use of primary documents\u2014legal charters, memoirs, Jewish communal records, legal petitions, Hasidic tales, short stories, war reportage\u2014to give us the tools to reconstruct this history together. We will also watch films and critically assess the new Broadway production of Fiddler on the Roof.\nRequired Texts:\nGershon David Hundert, Jews in Poland-Lithuania in the Eighteenth Century: A Genealogy of Modernity (University of California Press, 2004).

This course will treat those aspects of early modern French history. We will move beyond Versailles and Paris, however, to place France in the dynamic context of colonial expansion in the New World, Africa and Asia. Consumer revolutions brought tempting products from around the globe and helped France emerge as the center of fashion. Luxury goods\u2014silks, wigs, parasols, chocolate, and sugar\u2014poured from guild workshops and off ships in French ports. Cities vibrated with the emergence of restaurants, shops and coffee houses. Artists generated styles that appealed to new classes of consumers and developed novel marketing strategies. Writers excoriated the corruption of the court, royal finances, and the aristocracy. Wars and famine exacerbated suffering, especially in rural areas, and poor and working classes struggled to make a living in this rapidly changing society.\nFulfills the following History Concentrations: \u201cLaw, Economics, and Human Rights,\u201d \u201cEuropean History,\u201d \u201cGeneral Studies in History,\u201d \u201cWomen, Gender, and Sexuality,\u201d and \u201cEmpires, Nations, and Citizenship.\u201d\nGrading structure: Frequent pop quizzes, class discussion, midterm, and final examination.\nReadings include: Electronic readings on E-Reserve and J-Stor.

To answer these questions, this course will bring together two different, but related, arenas of historical memory: narrative (fiction and film) and public history (museums, memorials, and monuments). Our class will take us from the founding of the United States, through the history of the Civil War and slavery, and into contemporary debates about memorials and monuments. At the end of the course, we will focus on how the history of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement is commemorated, both generally in the United States and here in Atlanta.\nThis course fulfills the continuing writing requirement. Students will complete three writing assignments. The first two will be of medium length (five pages); the final assignment will be more ambitious, and it will require students to investigate a topic of their own choosing related to the course. Class participation is essential, and we will also take two field trips to observe the presentation of history in Atlanta.\nLikely texts include Octavia Butler, Kindred (Beacon); Owen Dwyer and Derek Alderman, Civil RightsMemorials and the Geography of Memory (Columbia College); Charles Johnson, Dreamer: A Novel (Scribner); Philip Roth, The Plot Against America (Vintage); and Erika Doss, Memorial Mania: Public Feeling in America (Chicago).

Marx exposed the relation between ideas and their material origins; Nietzsche called the very idea of truth into question; and Freud suggested that human existence itself rests on dark and unexamined foundations. The founders, both consciously and unwittingly, of movements that attempted to use their insights to transform politics and culture, these intellectual revolutionaries changed the landscape of modern life. In this course, we will focus not only on understanding their ideas and methods but also on learning how to deploy them ourselves.\nAs critical thinkers committed to extending the power of self-reflection into new regions, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud were the inheritors and extenders of the enlightenment. But all three were also highly aware of the power of the irrational to shape human existence. The tension between rationality and irrationality is at the heart of the distinctive new ways of thinking associated with their names. This course will closely examine the ideas of each of these \u201cmasters\u201d of argument: we will study each on his own terms, engaging in careful and critical readings of major works. We will also practice using the paradigms they developed by reading a major literary work from Marxian, Nietzschean, and Freudian perspectives. Throughout the course, we will also be concerned to think about the methods of each thinker in relation to the others.\nReadings include:\nRequired: Freud Civilization and Its Discontents, The Interpretation of Dreams Nietzsche, On the Genealogy of Morality and Other Writings, Twilight of the Idols or How to Philosophize With a Hammer, Tucker, ed., The Marx-Engels Reader.", "topic": "Topic:", "schedule": [{"time": "11:30am - 12:45pm", "days": "TuTh", "instructor": "Goodstein, Elizabeth Sarah"}], "notes": "", "ger": "HAPW"}, {"name": "HIST387RW-000: GA Civil Rights Cold Cases", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "none", "Grading": "none", "Related Courses": "AAS387RW-000\nAMST387RW-000\nENGCW385RW-000", "credit": "4", "opus_number": "4864", "Descriptions": "In the years between 1945 and 1968, untold numbers of American citizens were targeted for death because of their race, beliefs, or civil rights work \u2013 and in some cases merely because of what they drove, how they spoke, or the ever-shifting lines of racial etiquette they crossed. In many cases, their murders were inadequately investigated or prosecuted, their stories left untold, and the crimes against their humanity never punished. The Georgia Civil Rights Cold Cases Project at Emory University is both a class and an ongoing historical and journalistic exploration of the Jim Crow South through the prism of unsolved or unpunished civil rights-era murders in Georgia. Using primary evidence \u2013 including FBI records, NAACP files, old newspaper clippings, court transcripts, and personal archives \u2013 students come to see and understand history from the inside out. Student essays, grounded in secondary readings that provide broader context, will be aimed at the project website, coldcases.emory.edu, which was launched in early 2015. \nStudents should budget for photocopying. \nNOTE: This course is not open to first-year students.

I will read your work closely, make comments on your theme, your structure, your language, word selection, grammar, punctuation, spelling and citations, as well as your integration of primary evidence and secondary material.  You will write a 10- to 12-page midterm and a final paper that is a smaller, sharper, web-ready distillation of your midterm paper. I will build in time for peer review of your work. I will meet with you out of class to focus on both the research and the writing. You will see that I am as serious about your mastery of writing as we are of your command of the historical events we will examine. Our goal is not merely for you to learn and understand the history, but to be able to convey it clearly.

The year of his birth (1756) coincided with the beginning of the Seven Years War, arguably the first global military conflict in European history. His death in 1791 came two years after the outbreak of the French Revolution. The intervening years witnessed both the onset of political crisis throughout the major regimes of the continent, and the burst of cultural creativity and production we associate with the European Enlightenment. This course uses Mozart's biography, travels, and music as a vehicle for exploring broader issues in European history during this period. As such the class requires no special training or background in music or music history.The first half focuses on Mozart's world through his letters and his travels to the major European capitals of his day. The second half uses Mozart\u2019s major operas as primary texts. These operas, as we will see, were all about women. Some were virtuous and enlightened, others malicious and manipulative; some were victims, others agents of their own destiny; some embodied older misogynist stereotypes still prevalent in Mozart\u2019s day, others a fundamentally new attitude toward women and gender relations in general. But women, whatever their character and personalities, dominated Mozart\u2019s stage, and his operas continue to offer profound insights into the themes of love, sex, lust and power. \nThis course can be applied to the History major concentrations in either European History or Women, Gender, and Sexuality. \nASSIGNED READINGS Aside from the following texts, all other course materials will be available through Reserves Direct.

To understand contemporary Russia and leaders like Vladimir Putin, we must consider Russia\u2019s imperial and colonial legacy.

This can be intimidating especially since the lifestyles we know and enjoy often do not coincide with sustainability. Some scholars believe that unless we alter our behaviors, our future on Earth is in question. However, behavior changes are easier said than done. The purpose of this course is to provide students with an overview of social science research on sustainability-related behavioral change, with attention to values, attitudes, identity, habits, barriers and rewards to change. This survey focuses on mainly on social psychology, but will include other social and natural science disciplines as well.  The course will give students an opportunity to apply these theories through a sustainability-related intervention on campus or in the Atlanta community.  Methods of evaluation and assessment of change will be combined with this hands-on project to give students experience with behavior change in all its complexity.  Students will become familiar with theories, practices, interventions and policy implications for sustainability.

This seminar tackles these complex and enduring questions through the lens of religious conversions to and from Judaism, from the forced conversions of Jews in late medieval Iberia (known disparagingly as marranos) to the relatively recent phenomenon of conversions to Judaism (like the famous Marilyn Monroe). We will examine ideas about and attitudes toward conversion in various places and times, and how conversions have forced groups and converts to define their outermost boundaries and formalize criteria for membership and exclusion. We will pay attention to the political and socio-economic factors affecting Jewish conversions in medieval Christian Europe. We will explore how modern notions of nationalism, race, and ethnicity have complicated the ideal of conversion as a rebirth and undermined converts\u2019 ability to fully abandon their former identitiesat the baptismal font.\nTopics of study will include: Inquisition, conversos and crypto-Jews; the conversion \u201ccraze\u201d in Victorian England and the Jewish role in millenarian expectations; converts as translators of Jewish culture in Christian Europe; nationalism, race and the immutability of identity; Holocaust and the legacy of child baptisms by rescuers; conversion, bio-politics and the Jewish state; Ethiopian Jews in Israel; celebrity conversions to Judaism; and recent conversion debates regarding rabbinic abuse in the mikvah, convert bill of rights, and new conversion courts.\n  Required Texts:\nRenee Levine Melammed, Heretics or Daughters of Israel?

It also examines the question of evidence, or how we can know or make claims about the experience and circumstance of suffering. We will start by comparing classical Greek, Jewish and Buddhist texts that outline radically different approaches to a problem they all recognize, and then move on to consider literature from the Holocaust, ethnographic accounts of illness, suffering and healing in different cultures, and firsthand accounts of contemporary man-made and natural disasters, like the genocide in Rwanda, or the AIDS pandemic. How do human beings find healing or transcendence in the face of implacable fate, and how does our response to suffering stand at the very heart of different choices in contemporary politics? How can different disciplines, such as anthropology, the study of religious texts or literature offer different kinds of evidence about the human condition?

It will begin by defining the Jewish populations in space and time and then take up the origins and major movements of those populations using the evidence of demography, genetics, archeology, ethnology, and history. Jewish cultures considered include those of the First and Second Temples, the Talmudic and medieval eras, the Central European Diaspora (especially the culture of the shtetl), the Jews of Spain and Islam, the Yiddishists of modern Europe, the Jews of the United States, and the cultures of the kibbutz and the army in modern Israel. Distinctive Jewish communities such as those of Ethiopia, Yemen, India, and China will be discussed.  The primary Jewish languages--Hebrew, Yiddish, Judeo-Spanish, and others--will be briefly considered, along with their use for purposes as distinct as Biblical exegesis and troubadour poetry, prophetic declamation and modern comic fiction, prayer, curse, contract, song, and magic.

Many of the signature features of modern Jewish life\u2014in the realms of religion, culture, language, and politics (Hasidism, modern Jewish literature, Yiddish, Zionism, revolutionary socialism)\u2014derive from the centuries-long robust Jewish civilization in the East.

We will explore: how and why Jews migrated from Western to Eastern Europe in the middle ages; the Jewish-Noble economic symbiosis in early-modern Poland-Lithuania and the impact of the Chmielnicki Uprising of 1648-49; the messianic upheavals of Sabbatianism and Frankism; the development of Hasidism and its opponents; the 1772-1795 partitions of Poland and the creation of Russian Jewry; Russian Jewish Enlightenment (Haskalah) and changing attitudes towards religion and \u201cJewishness\u201d; the rise of mass politics and new forms of Jewish self-expression (nationalism, Zionism, socialism, Yiddishism); WWI, the Russian Revolution, and Bolshevism; inter-war Jewish life in independent Poland; the Holocaust in the Soviet Union; and the culture of memory about this lost world that has emerged in its aftermath. This course will make extensive use of primary documents\u2014legal charters, memoirs, Jewish communal records, legal petitions, Hasidic tales, short stories, war reportage\u2014to give us the tools to reconstruct this history together.

How and why did the Zionists succeed and the Arabs did not? Local, regional, and international politics from 1914 to 1949 are discussed in detail. The second half of the course focuses on the emergence of Israel and the Palestinian refugee issue, Arab politics, Middle Eastern wars, the Israeli quest for normalization, and the origins and fragmentation of Palestinian nationalism.  A core of the course reviews the diplomatic successes and failures in seeking the conflict\u2019s resolution, and especially the role played by the United States.

It is often taken for granted that Romanticism played a preeminent role in the formation of nation states across Latin America, yet it is also assumed that Romantic artists were mainly concerned with nature, love, pain, and the sublime.  The portrait we often craft of these lyrical Romantics willing to jettison their daily connection with the rational imperatives of the Enlightenment is not only a caricature; it seems at odds with the evidence one can collect after taking a less cursory look at their literary production.  Tackling this problem will lead us to call into question to what extent we can in fact consider Latin American Romanticism as a literary movement enlisting men and women willing to adopt a diffuse, nonchalant attitude towards politics in a continent fraught with gargantuan political conflicts.  If the case actually is that a commanding \u201craison d\u2019\u00c9tat\u201d (reason of State or, more aptly, national interest) shaped the main works of Romantic writers such as Jos\u00e9 de Alencar (Brazil), Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Samper (Colombia), Gertrudis G\u00f3mez de Avellaneda (Spain/Cuba), Andr\u00e9s Bello (Venezuela/Chile), or Esteban Echeverr\u00eda (Argentina), how can we reconcile these rather earthly political interests with the celestial heights of the \u201cbeautiful soul\u201d sought by the Romantic artist\u2019s intuition?\n  PARTICULARS: Evaluation based on active participation in class, written assignments, oral presentations and a final research paper.", "topic": "Latin American Romanticisms", "schedule": [{"time": "11:00am - 11:50am", "days": "MWF", "instructor": "Feldman, Hernan"}], "notes": "", "ger": ""}, {"name": "LACS490R-001: Adv.Sem:Lat Amer & Caribbn Std", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "none", "Grading": "none", "Related Courses": "SPAN460-000", "credit": "3", "opus_number": "6049", "Descriptions": "Topics vary.

Topics covered will include aphasia and other language disorders, sentence processing, lexical representation in the brain, hemispheric specialization, typical and atypical language development, bilingualism and dyslexia.", "topic": "none", "schedule": [{"time": "4:00pm - 5:15pm", "days": "TuTh", "instructor": "Wolff, Phillip"}], "notes": "", "ger": "SNT"}, {"name": "LING316-000: Language Acquisition", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "none", "Grading": "none", "Related Courses": "PSYC316-000", "credit": "3", "opus_number": "1031", "Descriptions": "Language acquisition in young children. Identifying speech sounds, determining meaning, and comprehending the rules of syntax.\nThe study of language development is central to our understanding of human behavior because it engages issues of brain organization and processes, symbolic capacity, knowledge representation, socialization, communication, and culture. Moreover, study of the origins and course of normal language development raises important theoretical issues in both linguistics and psychology (e.g., innateness of grammar, the nature of bilingualism, language and thought). Because language defines us as human and the study of language is connected to so many areas of linguistics and psychology, it is an important and very active area of scholarship. This course surveys the normal course of language development, variations in language development, and competing theoretical accounts of how development occurs.\nBecoming familiar with (learning how to read, understand, and synthesize) published research articles is a primary aim of the course that you\u2019ll work toward by closely analyzing a number of research papers and by writing a research paper. Writing is a powerful way to learn because it requires you to formulate a thesis and organize your thinking on a particular research topic. Also, this course will provide hands-on experience in using and analyzing corpus from CHILDES database.\nRequired Textbook:\nO'Grady, William. 2005. How Children Learn Language.

Different aspects of media will be covered, ranging from the political economy of the media, to the media as news and entertainment. We will analyze the language of the news and investigate the notion of media bias or the selection and presentation of news. We will pay particular attention to issues of media representation of gender, race, class, and nation state. Finally, we will look at the internet as a new medium, its potential for the democratization of communication in a context of globalization. In the course, we will take up a range of question: Who owns the media? Does ownership affect media content? Can advertisers influence media programs? Is there more to the selection of news than time, space, and cultural constraints? Does the internet weaken large media companies\u2019 control over information and empower people with unlimited access to alternative information? In attempting to answer these questions we will take up broader concepts, such as hegemony and ideology, and the role of language in shaping people\u2019s consciousness.\nRequired textbooks:\nBen H.

This course introduces students to the principles of language variation and change, covering case studies in phonetics and phonology, morphology, lexicon, syntax and discourse. Students will collect and analyze their own linguistic data through a variety of techniques, including sociolinguistic interviews, rapid-and-anonymous surveys, experimental methods and corpus studies. Because progress in research depends crucially on sharing our findings with others, a central focus of the course will be on the development of writing and presentation skills.

Both are composed of sounds combined into complex sequences. Both also exhibit tonality, pitch, and rhythm and often convey affective meaning. Given similarities between language and music, clarifying their underlying mechanisms and evolutionary origins will aid in defining the functional significance of language and music in human cognition.\nThis course is designed to engage students in in-depth discussion on empirical and theoretical issues surrounding the relation between these two complex, perhaps uniquely human, phenomena. We will examine the following questions: \nWhat are the components of language and music? To what extent are language and music processed similarly? \nTo what extent are language and music modular in nature? What are the neural mechanisms underlying language and music processing? \nHow did language and music evolve?

What is the explicit purpose of each particular translation? This course will examine these issues, challenge your knowledge of syntax, slang and colloquialisms, expand the registers you are comfortable with (advertising, literary, political, poetic) and compel you to consider multiple linguistic nuances in both English and Spanish.\nOver the semester you will become acquainted with the history and many of the theories of translation, as well as basic methods/techniques and problems of translating between English and Spanish. The main focus will be on Spanish as the source language (SL) and English as the target (TL), although you will also do a limited amount of translation into Spanish, as well as English-to-English translation.

These phases, which have come to be known as the three yanas or vehicles, are called the Pratimokshayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana. Tibetan Buddhism as a living tradition is unique in that it represents the latest phase of the Buddhist teachings.  The tradition itself enjoyed over 1300 years of uninterrupted development, and it incorporates all three seemingly distinct Buddhist vehicles or approaches in a coherent way.  This course will present the various psychological principles, theories and methods that underlie these approaches.  For purposes of context, the course will begin with a brief survey of the basic terms and concepts that inform the Buddhist worldview.

How and why did the Zionists succeed and the Arabs did not? Local, regional, and international politics from 1914 to 1949 are discussed in detail.

It begins with an overview of the region\u2019s history, starting with the advent of Islam and continuing through the eras of colonialism and national independence.  Topics to be addressed include the formation of the modern Arab state system, the creation of Israel and the origins of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the rise of Arab nationalism.  Next we examine the dynamics of authoritarian rule and state-led development, comparing patterns of governance and state-society relations in selected Arab republics (Egypt, Syria, Iraq and Libya) and Arab monarchies (Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Morocco).  We then look at  regime change via foreign intervention in Iraq,  and at the causes, dynamics and consequences of the protest wave known as the \u201cArab Spring\u201d, seeking to explain divergent outcomes in Egypt, Tunisia, Syria and Libya.  At the end of the course, we consider the prospects for economic development, democratization and national reconciliation in the Arab Middle East, with the aim of discerning key structural, institutional and cultural challenges and alternate pathways of change.\nReadings:\nGelvin, James; The Israel-Palestine Conflict: One Hundred Years of War; 3rd edition, 2014.\nGunning, Jeroen and Ilan Zvi Baron, Why Occupy a Square?: People, Protests and Movements in the Egyptian Revolution, 2014.\nLippman, Thomas; Saudi Arabia on the Edge: The Uncertain Future of an American Ally, 2012.\nPlus selected book chapters and journal articles\nX", "topic": "Politics of the Middle East", "schedule": [{"time": "2:30pm - 3:45pm", "days": "TuTh", "instructor": "Samuel, Michael"}, {"time": "2:30pm - 3:45pm", "days": "TuTh", "instructor": "Wickham, Carrie Rosefsky"}], "notes": "", "ger": "HSC"}, {"name": "MESAS370-008: Special Topics MESAS-300 Level", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "none", "Grading": "none", "Related Courses": "SOC389-002", "credit": "3", "opus_number": "4869", "Descriptions": "Special topics in Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies, at the 300 level; may be repeated when content varies.\nInstructor: Erik Love\nThis course considers a growing (if belated) scholarly literature on discrimination affecting Arab, Muslim, Sikh, and South Asian Americans\u2014or \u201cIslamophobia.\u201d We will evaluate the effect of the framework of race and racism on a diverse collection of peoples who have built communities in the United States: including Afghans, Asian Indians, Chaldeans, Iranians, Kurds, Turks, Pakistanis, and many more national, ethnic, and religious groups.

We will look at the administrative structure that Akbar the Great put in place, the organization that the British inherit in the eighteenth century.

Yet, with the advent of the scientific renaissance and revolution in the 16th century, the sciences have both become more specialized and moved away from academic philosophy. Despite this, science has nevertheless enjoyed a rich and productive discourse with philosophy, both in its inception and during the quantum revolution of the 1920s. In this course we will examine the history of the philosophy of science through the writings of Isaac Newton, Francis Bacon, Rene Descartes and see how they came to define (and later challenge) the scientific method particularly through the scientific methodology of Pierre-Simon Laplace and William Whewell in the 18th and 19th century. We will examine the philosophical reflections of 20th century quantum theorists like Werner Heisenberg, Niels Bohr, and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, who turned to philosophy in the wake of the crisis in modern science and mathematics. Finally, we will examine some critiques given by 20th century philosophers from the \u201coutside looking in\u201d to the theory and practice of science.

Marx exposed the relation between ideas and their material origins; Nietzsche called the very idea of truth into question; and Freud suggested that human existence itself rests on dark and unexamined foundations. The founders, both consciously and unwittingly, of movements that attempted to use their insights to transform politics and culture, these intellectual revolutionaries changed the landscape of modern life. In this course, we will focus not only on understanding their ideas and methods but also on learning how to deploy them ourselves.\nAs critical thinkers committed to extending the power of self-reflection into new regions, Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud were the inheritors and extenders of the enlightenment. But all three were also highly aware of the power of the irrational to shape human existence. The tension between rationality and irrationality is at the heart of the distinctive new ways of thinking associated with their names. This course will closely examine the ideas of each of these \u201cmasters\u201d of argument: we will study each on his own terms, engaging in careful and critical readings of major works. We will also practice using the paradigms they developed by reading a major literary work from Marxian, Nietzschean, and Freudian perspectives.

What does this type of diversity mean for American politics?  Does it suggest that race, ethnicity and gender are not obstacles to getting elected?  Are voters from particular gender or minority groups more or less likely to vote for diverse candidates?  How do other factors, like party, ideology, region or religion, affect a candidate\u2019s likelihood of winning election?  In this seminar, we explore the ways that racial/ethnic and gender identity can help predict mass political behavior and the likelihood of a candidate\u2019s success.  We will discuss racial and gender differences in party identification and voting behavior.  We will also look at the ways that campaigns appeal to racial and gender identities to win votes.

Put simply, the study of public policy examines what government does (or doesn\u2019t do) to address societal problems and what difference it makes. While public policy can be studied as either a dependent variable (what are the determinants of a particular government policy?) or an independent variable (what effect does a particular policy have on a public problem?), the emphasis in this course will be on the former. Our principal objective is to examine the processes through which individuals, organizations, and institutions interact to shape government policies. We will focus on how variations in the nature and scope of public issues, institutional structures, and decision making processes affect the capacity of governments to act (or not to act) to solve important public problems.

Additionally, this course is required for all students seeking to apply for the fellowship in Community Building and Social Change.\nThis is a course about community building and social change in urban America. Community Building refers to \"locally focused approaches to collective problem-solving that aim to solve problems and to promote socially valuable forms of connectedness, sustained stakeholder engagement, a sense of common purpose, and greater institutional capacity.\" Social Change refers to the positive externalities (i.e., good consequences) of community building that broaden the access of disadvantaged communities to social, economic, and political opportunities. The course addresses a number of tensions and issues that affect community building, and the processes through which community builders attempt to foster social change in and around cities in the United States. It approaches the tensions and issues through a mix of theoretically-informed lectures, individual and group exercises, and the examination of a variety of case studies of contemporary community building initiatives through texts, film, and on occasion audio. The course is lecture-based but includes a small set of opportunities for student dialogue in and beyond the classroom. Furthermore, students should not expect that a course on \"community building and social change\" either lacks theoretical rigor or is a course full of opinion-based discussion and field trips to \"the community.\"\nThe course has five goals:\n1. Introduce students to the theoretical consideration of and applied principles that support community building as an approach to addressing collective problems in metropolitan America, inclusive of cities and suburbs;\n2. Provide students with a set of theoretical and analytic perspectives for examining urban issues and fostering social change;\n3. Assist students in identifying the interconnections among demography, culture, economy, and polity, and the global, national, state, regional, and neighborhood forces affecting metropolitan communities;\n4. Lay a foundation for students to eventually engage in analysis, reflection, and application of the key determinants of successful community building initiatives and to understand the core competencies needed for successful community builders;\n5. Prepare interested students to apply for participation in Emory University's Community Building and Social Change Fellowship.\nIn the end, the hope is that this course will give students a solid understanding of the challenges, dynamics, and promise of metropolitan communities (i.e., urban and suburban), along with an appreciation for the complexity and opportunities of fostering social change. Together, these elements should ensure that students have a breadth of knowledge about community building that will permit them to confidently explore and deeply engage more complex issues at and beyond Emory University.\nClass Section Homepage: http://www.oucp.emory.edu/our_work/engaged_learning/cbsc_index.html#community building social change\nTexts:\nTBD", "topic": "none", "schedule": [{"time": "9:00am - 9:50am", "days": "MWF", "instructor": "Rich, Michael"}], "notes": "", "ger": "HSC"}, {"name": "POLS375-000: Contemp.

This class will trace the relationship from the remote past of the 18th century when the U.S. just emerged from the long war for independence and when China\u2019s precipitous decline was about to begin to September 2015 when President Xi Jinping of China was received by President Obama on the South Lawn of the White House. This review of the highs and lows of the tumultuous relationship in the past 232 years is designed to examine the decision-making of some of the most decisive policies made in Washington and Beijing to the other, their mutual impact as well as global consequences. The course will also attempt to identify the main factors that are influencing and will continue to sway the relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies and most powerful nations. Students are expected to have some basic knowledge of the relationship and will certainly leave the class with much deeper understanding of the domestic, ideological, political and strategic factors that have not only made this relationship both highly uncertain and unpredictable but also too important to fail.    \nTexts: TBD", "topic": "U.S./China Relations", "schedule": [{"time": "4:00pm - 5:15pm", "days": "MW", "instructor": "Liu, Yawei"}], "notes": "", "ger": ""}, {"name": "POLS385-001: Spec.

Under what conditions can labor as a collective force contribute to both greater efficiency and to democracy? To address these questions, the course will combine a theoretical focus with analyses of concrete, substantive issues. The theoretical focus involves basic features of labor economics and contemporary labor markets (e.g. the shift toward informality), the shifting nature of labor processes (e.g. \"flexible\" production, work in the service industry), and, most critically, the political factors, especially institutions and interests, that affect labor\u2019s capacity for political influence and engagement in production. These will help to frame our discussions of substantive issues, such as migration and informal/contract labor, skills formation, economic and political (in)equality), foreign investment and labor standards, and the quality of democracy.  Although most of our discussion will focus on the \u201cdeveloping world,\u201d we will address these issues in the U.S. context where, as reflected in the presidential primaries, they are taking on great importance.", "ger": "", "schedule": [{"time": "4:00pm - 5:15pm", "days": "TuTh", "instructor": "Doner, Richard F"}], "Related Courses": "none", "topic": "Politics of Labor&Development"}, {"name": "POLS385-002: Spec.

Why do states choose to organize their interactions using international institutions of various types? Why do such institutions take on the form that they do? How do they work? How effective are they in shaping outcomes and behaviors in world politics, and under what circumstances?

As a political concept, however, it is not fully investigated\u2014especially its impact on political behavior and effective governance. This upper-division seminar will systematically study monitoring in political affairs, with an emphasis on comparative politics and international affairs. First, monitoring as a concept will be defined, especially in relation to other important concepts such as accountability. Second, we will question how monitoring is utilized in other disciplines such as psychology and economics. Third, seminar participants will ask \u201cWhat is effective monitoring?\u201d Fourth, students will investigate the importance of monitoring in democratic theory and ask empirically-driven questions such as \u201cHow do people monitor their governments?\u201d Finally, explanatory factors such as transparency on effective monitoring in political affairs will be identified.

This course surveys the normal course of language development, variations in language development, and competing theoretical accounts of how development occurs.\nBecoming familiar with (learning how to read, understand, and synthesize) published research articles is a primary aim of the course that you\u2019ll work toward by closely analyzing a number of research papers and by writing a research paper. Writing is a powerful way to learn because it requires you to formulate a thesis and organize your thinking on a particular research topic. Also, this course will provide hands-on experience in using and analyzing corpus from CHILDES database.\nRequired Textbook:\nO'Grady, William. 2005. How Children Learn Language.

The course is intended to satisfy the Emory College-wide undergraduate requirements for a research based laboratory methods course.\nObjective: This course will train enrolled students in theoretical and methodological aspects of psychophysiological recordings as a paradigmatic approach to the study of human stress, e.g., heart rate variability and electroencephalogram measurements. In addition the course will also expose students to \u201cwet laboratory\u201d techniques in the analysis of body fluids (urine, saliva) that are obtained through non-invasive methods that do not require radio-active markers or expensive laboratory equipment, but allow for evaluation of hormone levels, DNA extraction and autonomic nervous system activity. \nUpon completion of this course students will be familiar with laboratory techniques used in neuro-behaviorally oriented research that incorporates analysis of biological samples, physiologic activity and behavioral responses. Successful completion of the course should prepare students for graduate level work in laboratories that utilize these approaches with a solid theoretical and \u201chands on\u201d knowledge of their value in understanding human behavior.\nAs part of the Emory College Research Initiative that focuses on education and research in the cognitive science within the psychology department, including the development of the imaging center for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) this course will help augment that focus. Behavioral science is an interdisciplinary field of inquiry. Undergraduate students who acquire research sophistication that includes molecular, physiologic, behavioral and cognitive approaches will be highly competitive for post-graduate and professional school admission. Through this course they will also internalize the values of critical thinking and evidence based approaches to knowledge acquisition. These values have recently been the focus of Emory College\u2019s freshman seminar.\nThe objectives and goals of this learning experience will be accomplished through a 3 credit course that includes didactic instruction (20%) and \u201chands on\u201d laboratory methods (60%) with a final term paper (20%). The course will be conducted in the Psychology and Interdisciplinary Studies building. It will utilize the building\u2019s under-used wet laboratory and the Center for Neuropsychological Studies laboratory.

We will examine the symptoms of psychotic disorders and their developmental course across the life span. The class will also cover empirical findings on etiology and neural mechanisms underlying psychotic symptoms.\nOverview: This seminar is intended to provide an overview of current scientific knowledge about the nature and origins of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.  All levels of analysis will be covered; behavioral, cognitive, and biological.  The format will be lecture, viewing of videotapes of patients, student reports on scientific articles, and class discussion.   We will begin by covering the symptoms associated with psychosis and the epidemiology of psychotic disorders, including sex differences, cross cultural factors, and developmental characteristics.  Videotaped interviews of patients will be used to examine the behavioral phenomenology of the psychotic disorders.   The major areas of inquiry in the field of psychosis research will then be addressed.  We will cover the empirical research findings on the origins of vulnerability to psychosis, including genetic and environmental factors.  In the next phase, cognitive and behavioral correlates of psychosis will be examined.   Moving to the biological level, we will examine the major findings from neuroimaging and postmortem research dealing with structural and functional brain abnormalities.   Neurotransmitter and neurohormonal factors will also be covered.  Throughout the semester, we will consider the implications of the research findings for models of the etiology of psychosis.   We will also return to some of the major questions facing the field;\nWhat, if any, are the key defining elements of psychotic disorders? \nWhat is the relative contribution of inherited versus acquired vulnerabilities to the etiology of psychotic disorders?\nWhat is the relative contribution of inherited versus acquired vulnerabilities to the etiology of psychotic disorders? \nWhy does the risk for onset of psychosis change so dramatically across the life course?\nIs the neurocircuitry abnormality involved in psychosis primarily attributable to one neurotransmitter or neurocircuit, or due to the interaction among multiple neural systems?\nAfter the first two classes, in each subsequent class meeting, there will be assigned readings, with students taking primary responsibility for presenting an article and co-leading a discussion of the research findings.    Grades will be determined on the basis of class participation and an end-of-semester research paper that will be described in detail in class.

This course explores the \"religious\" dimensions of travel in premodern and modern religious texts from and about Asia, while considering in depth the key terms \"pilgrimage,\" \"sacred space,\" and \"tourism.\" An investigation of these terms offers a unique vantage point for introducing some of the critical terms and issues in the study of religion, including the holy or sacred, experience, liminality, relic and image, the dynamic of ritual and belief; the various tensions between religious orthodoxy and popular piety, local and trans-local practices, the \u201cmodern/secular\u201d and the \u201cpre- modern/religious;\u201d and finally, the political dimensions of western depictions of Asia. The course pays particular attention to the ways in which pilgrimage and ritualized travel persist in modernity, first by examining active pilgrimages in modern Asia, and second, by investigating theories of tourism/secular space and depictions of Asia in western travel literature. Thus crisscrossing time (modern/premodern) and space (East/West), we will reconsider what it means to be modern.", "ger": "FSEM", "schedule": [{"time": "1:00pm - 2:15pm", "days": "MW", "instructor": "Geslani, Marko"}], "Related Courses": "none", "topic": "Pilgrimage and Tourism"}, {"name": "REL190-002: Fresh Sem: Religion", "Grading": "none", "Related Courses": "JS190-002", "credit": "3", "opus_number": "2394", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "Texts TBA", "Descriptions": "Dynamics of inquiry on a focused research topic.

We will start by comparing classical Greek, Jewish and Buddhist texts that outline radically different approaches to a problem they all recognize, and then move on to consider literature from the Holocaust, ethnographic accounts of illness, suffering and healing in different cultures, and firsthand accounts of contemporary man-made and natural disasters, like the genocide in Rwanda, or the AIDS pandemic. How do human beings find healing or transcendence in the face of implacable fate, and how does our response to suffering stand at the very heart of different choices in contemporary politics?

And there are others: insider/outsider, liberative/oppressive, according to a theological or a \u201cscientific\u201d approach. And disciplinary differences: sociological, psychological, literary, textual, theological, ethical, and so on. And we divide \u201creligion\u201d into the individual religious traditions, such as Buddhism and Christianity. All of these distinctions have their own troubled history and their own logic. What counts as religion, and who gets to decide? What do we say when someone says their religion isn\u2019t a religion? We should look at the margins of the category: at entertainment as religion (and religion as entertainment). Is yoga religious? Is atheism a religion? Is Jedi a religion? If I go to a temple and ask the Buddha\u2019s help to get rich, or to kill my enemies, what do we call that?\nWe have a rich heritage of studying religion. In this class, we review some key moments in the emergence of the modern Western study of religion, and get a sense of religious studies as a professional/institutional field. We explore a series of inter-related key issues in the contemporary study of religion, including: modernity, territory, performance, gender, religious experience, belief, icons and relics, and rationality. We look at a number of case studies: who gets to speak for a religion? What are the ethics and politics of speaking on behalf of a religion? Or criticizing one? Is religion what we fight about?

These phases, which have come to be known as the three yanas or vehicles, are called the Pratimokshayana, Mahayana and Vajrayana.

The tradition itself enjoyed over 1300 years of uninterrupted development, and it incorporates all three seemingly distinct Buddhist vehicles or approaches in a coherent way.

His work in these two fields has provided him the opportunity to engage in dialogue with renowned scientists, researchers, education specialists, and world leaders in addition to religious leaders of all faiths. With the turn of the century, His Holiness the Dalai Lama has called for a new kind of education: one that examines a set of fundamental human values that are the basis of our shared humanity and pay homage to the interdependent nature of our increasingly globalized society. Modern scientific research is showing that our capacity for compassion, empathy, and love is deeply ingrained, and His Holiness has many teachings that can help us learn to cultivate these positive qualities. His Holiness\u2019s books, Ethics for the New Millennium and Beyond Religion: Ethics for a Whole World, outline what he refers to as \u201csecular ethics,\u201d an idea of a set of ethics that is not dependent on a particular belief system or religious framework but is instead universal and inclusive of people of all or no religious affiliation. In essence, His Holiness is proposing an approach to ethics that is grounded in scientific evidence and supported by both personal experience and common sense. In this course, students will study principles of His Holiness\u2019s secular ethics and engage in thoughtful discussion of how to infuse these ideals into aspects of our society such as education, family life, and other social structures. Grading will be based on an intensive group project and an individual final paper, as well as class participation and weekly responses. \nRequired texts:\nH.H.

Survey of the masterpieces of the Golden Age of Russian literature presented against the background of historical, cultural, social, and political developments.\nRussia is the largest country in the world. To understand contemporary Russia and leaders like Vladimir Putin, we must consider Russia\u2019s imperial and colonial legacy. Imperial Russia under the tsars was a powerful autocracy, but it was also a site of daring intellectual inquiry and defiant thought. Imperial Russia spawned \u201cgiants\u201d in global culture like Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, as well as political terrorists and revolutionaries like Lenin and Stalin. Russia remains the largest country in the world. Straddling the continents of Europe and Asia, Tsarist Russia was torn between those who wanted Russia to \u201cWesternize\u201d and those who wanted Russia to define her own place in the global order. This question about Russia\u2019s mission not only extended into the Soviet era but also is central to debates about Russia today. To address foundations of such issues, this course focuses on the vibrant forum of Russian culture in the pivotal 19th and early 20th centuries.

With this new vocabulary, we will ask and consider such questions as: What is culture? How does it work?\nWe then evaluate the classical treatments of culture by Marx, Weber, and Durkheim. This examination allows us to see how the issues they raised are treated today. Contemporary considerations include: How do people in one group exclude people from another group? Can religion survive in modern times?\nThe final section of the course will consist of a close look at a few substantive areas within the sociology of culture.  We will consider how culture supports the enactment of social activities and the existence of social groups to deal with such issues as: How is artistic production shaped by social and cultural factors?

We pay particular attention to the role of culture in explaining persistent inequality in the distribution of resources and power. We do so in three ways: First, we explore theoretical tools and vocabulary, including exploration of culture in classical theory, to ask a fundamental question: \u201cWhat is culture and what does it do?\u201d Second, we consider the role of culture at the individual, organizational, and macro levels, including such issues as how race, class, and gender shape identity; cultural resistance and hegemony; the role of cultural tastes and cultural consumption in social reproduction; and how contests for the definitions of reality affect social movements, social problems, and politics. Finally, we discuss the role of new technologies in these processes, such as the #blacklivesmatter movement.

This course examines the reciprocal relationship between individual-level and group-level phenomena, beginning with a focus on the nature of social psychology, especially individual identity processes, and its methodology. Attention then turns to the thoughts and feelings of individuals in social interaction, including the dynamics of cognition, emotion, prejudice, and discrimination. The course concludes with an examination of group processes such as attraction, influence, power, status, and justice.

In this course, we will discuss both the biological myth and social reality of race. In particular, we will focus on the social significance of race by examining the reality of racial stratification, the reality of the experience of race, and the rationality of those who study racial dynamics and processes. During this course you will learn the origins of the concept race, explore the historical science and statistics used to justify racial thinking, and review several empirical works on race in Sociology.\nThe first portion of the course is aimed at disentangling biological and social constructions of race in scientific study. The readings and lectures for this part of the course are largely based on historical figures and events that played a role in the social origins of the racial construct. We will critically discuss the reality of race prior to the 16th century and the early science that validated the racial construct, the associated social hierarchy, and the eugenics movement.\nIn the second portion of the course, we will review a number of theoretical readings on the social science of race and ethnicity. The readings and lectures for this part of the course are largely based on social scientific explanations of race and ethnic relations. After assessing social scientific interpretations of biological constructions of race, we will survey early and contemporary sociological theories of race and ethnic relations and attend to the conceptual distinctions among prejudice, discrimination, and racism.\nThe third portion of the course will survey select empirical readings in Sociology on social sources of race, racial inequality, and racial policy in Sociology. After critically reviewing the current biological perspective on the relationship between race and intelligence, we examine sociological research that applies a social constructionist perspective to the study of crime, wealth, residential segregation, and labor markets. We conclude the course by assessing post-Civil Rights changes in America\u2019s racial attitudes, racial classification system, and racial policies.\nThe end product of the course is an in-depth understanding of the origins of race, the structure of racial hierarchy in the United States, and a fundamental understanding of many sociological theories and empirical analyses of race and racial stratification in America.\n ", "topic": "none", "schedule": [{"time": "8:30am - 9:45am", "days": "MW", "instructor": "Sewell, Abigail"}], "Related Courses": "none", "ger": "HSC"}, {"name": "SOC247-001: Racial & Ethnic Relations", "Grading": "none", "notes": "", "credit": "3", "opus_number": "2669", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "Golash-Boza, Tonya MariaRace & Racisms: A Critical Approach.\nISBN9780190238506\nTakaki, RonaldA Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural America\nISBN9780316022361\nBonilla-Silva, EduardoRacism without Racist: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Ineq.\nISBN9781442220553", "Descriptions": "Relations between and within groups, and conflict and cooperation in light of a number of models of social interaction.

Additionally, this course is required for all students seeking to apply for the fellowship in Community Building and Social Change.\nSemester Description:\nThis is a course about community building and social change in urban America. Community Building refers to \"locally focused approaches to collective problem-solving that aim to solve problems and to promote socially valuable forms of connectedness, sustained stakeholder engagement, a sense of common purpose, and greater institutional capacity.\" Social Change refers to the positive externalities (i.e., good consequences) of community building that broaden the access of disadvantaged communities to social, economic, and political opportunities. The course addresses a number of tensions and issues that affect community building, and the processes through which community builders attempt to foster social change in and around cities in the United States. It approaches the tensions and issues through a mix of theoretically-informed lectures, individual and group exercises, and the examination of a variety of case studies of contemporary community building initiatives through texts, film, and on occasion audio. The course is lecture-based but includes a small set of opportunities for student dialogue in and beyond the classroom. Furthermore, students should not expect that a course on \"community building and social change\" either lacks theoretical rigor or is a course full of opinion-based discussion and field trips to \"the community.\"\nThe course has five goals:\n1. Introduce students to the theoretical consideration of and applied principles that support community building as an approach to addressing collective problems in metropolitan America, inclusive of cities and suburbs;\n2. Provide students with a set of theoretical and analytic perspectives for examining urban issues and fostering social change;\n3. Assist students in identifying the interconnections among demography, culture, economy, and polity, and the global, national, state, regional, and neighborhood forces affecting metropolitan communities;\n4. Lay a foundation for students to eventually engage in analysis, reflection, and application of the key determinants of successful community building initiatives and to understand the core competencies needed for successful community builders;\n5. Prepare interested students to apply for participation in Emory University's Community Building and Social Change Fellowship.\nIn the end, the hope is that this course will give students a solid understanding of the challenges, dynamics, and promise of metropolitan communities (i.e., urban and suburban), along with an appreciation for the complexity and opportunities of fostering social change. Together, these elements should ensure that students have a breadth of knowledge about community building that will permit them to confidently explore and deeply engage more complex issues at and beyond Emory University.\nClass Section Homepage:\nhttp://www.oucp.emory.edu/our_work/engaged_learning/cbsc_index.html#community building social change\nTexts: TBD", "topic": "none", "schedule": [{"time": "9:00am - 9:50am", "days": "MWF", "instructor": "Rich, Michael"}], "notes": "", "ger": "HSC"}, {"name": "SOC389-001: Spec.

In-depth treatment of a topic in language, literature, or culture of the Luso-Hispanic world through readings, frequent writing assignments, and class discussions.\nCONTENT: This course \u2013 Citizenship and Belonging in the Hispanic World -- explores the many meanings of citizenship in the age of globalization and social networking, and in relation to such controversial issues as \u201cillegal\u201d immigration, multinational citizenship, same-sex marriage, and economic inequality.  We will also consider what citizenship means in different parts of the world and what it has meant at different historical times and places.  The course will be framed by these questions: Who belongs, who doesn't...and why? More importantly, how has the story of citizenship and belonging been told? With this background in mind, during the second half of the course we will explore the comparative -- historical and cross-cultural -- context for citizenship in the Hispanic world. More specifically, we will be looking at how citizenship, understood broadly as belonging to and participating in a civic community, has been defined in medieval Spain, colonial Spanish America, and the US borderlands from the early twentieth century to the present in hopes that this understanding might better inform highly charged discussions related to citizenship in the US today.\nAll students enrolled in this course will participate in engaged learning activities throughout the semester. These experiences will be treated as an additional \u201ctext\u201d for the course, providing a point of departure for understanding the negotiation of citizenship and belonging in Atlanta's Hispanic community.\nTEXT: Americo Paredes, George Washington G\u00f3mez; John Sayles, \u201cLone Star;\u201d Anthony Weston, A Rulebook for Arguments; additional readings on BlackBoard\n  PARTICULARS: Evaluation is based on active class participation, engaged learning activities, writing assignments, group project involving the creation of a topic-based library of primary and secondary sources and oral presentation.\n  PREREQUISITE: None", "topic": "Citizenship & the Hisp.

This course will examine representations of childhood and adolescence in Spanish, Latin American, and Latino literature and film, focusing on the ways that discourses for and about children\u2014including those we find in law, religion, education, and the creative arts\u2014are used to idealize or critique the cultures that produce them. How do children \u201cspeak\u201d through literature written by adults, and how is their apparent lack of discursive power exploited by writers and filmmakers when reassessing personal and national identity? We will seek to identify moments in which contradictory dualities emerge surrounding childhood: for instance, the opposition between a romantic-utopian vision (childhood as a time of innocence, creativity, and freedom) and a rationalist-dystopian vision (childhood as the locus of cruelty, dependence, and restraint); or the way that children are envisioned in competing political agendas between conservatives and progressives (obedient future citizens of the Nation-state or potential agents for dissidence and change). Selected readings\u2014Generaci\u00f3n X fiction, Latino growing up narratives, works that inscribe the traumatic violence of the Spanish Civil War and Franco r\u00e9gime or revolution and dictatorship in 20th-century Latin America\u2014will allow us to explore changing cultural assumptions about children and family life in specific political and social contexts of the Hispanic world.

The translation process involves analyzing and interpreting the original text, as well as lots of creativity in deciding how to render it in another language.

What is the explicit purpose of each particular translation? This course will examine these issues, challenge your knowledge of syntax, slang and colloquialisms, expand the registers you are comfortable with (advertising, literary, political, poetic) and compel you to consider multiple linguistic nuances in both English and Spanish.\n  Over the semester you will become acquainted with the history and many of the theories of translation, as well as basic methods/techniques and problems of translating between English and Spanish. The main focus will be on Spanish as the source language (SL) and English as the target (TL), although you will also do a limited amount of translation into Spanish, as well as English-to-English translation.

After nearly 40 years of authoritarian state control relying on censorship, violence, and other repressive measures, Spaniards gained the freedom to debate human rights questions freely in venues that had previously been off-limits: the press and television, literature, film, the public sphere of digital media. Spain is now one of the 144 countries world-wide that have ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; institutes and chairs of human rights have been created at Spanish universities in conjunction with the Unesco/Bilbao Prize for the Promotion of a Culture of Human Rights established in 2008. But how does this official discourse translate into cultural practice? And, conversely, how can literature and other art forms impact human rights concerns? What is the connection between the humanities and human rights? In considering these questions, this course will explore the exchanges between political, legal, and ethical discourses on human rights in Spain and recent cultural texts.   The course will focus on select areas in the human rights arena that have gained prominence in contemporary Spanish cultural production: domestic and global terrorism; immigration; and the memory wars that have emerged in recent decades over the Spanish Civil War and its aftermath. In their final projects students may explore these topics or pursue additional avenues of interest (language rights; women\u2019s/gay rights; children\u2019s rights; the Okupas and Indignados movement; environmental rights, etc.).\n  Texts: Will include examples of numerous genres, including journalism, literature (novels, short stories, poetry, memoirs), film, and social media.

It is often taken for granted that Romanticism played a preeminent role in the formation of nation states across Latin America, yet it is also assumed that Romantic artists were mainly concerned with nature, love, pain, and the sublime.  The portrait we often craft of these lyrical Romantics willing to jettison their daily connection with the rational imperatives of the Enlightenment is not only a caricature; it seems at odds with the evidence one can collect after taking a less cursory look at their literary production.  Tackling this problem will lead us to call into question to what extent we can in fact consider Latin American Romanticism as a literary movement enlisting men and women willing to adopt a diffuse, nonchalant attitude towards politics in a continent fraught with gargantuan political conflicts.  If the case actually is that a commanding \u201craison d\u2019\u00c9tat\u201d (reason of State or, more aptly, national interest) shaped the main works of Romantic writers such as Jos\u00e9 de Alencar (Brazil), Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Samper (Colombia), Gertrudis G\u00f3mez de Avellaneda (Spain/Cuba), Andr\u00e9s Bello (Venezuela/Chile), or Esteban Echeverr\u00eda (Argentina), how can we reconcile these rather earthly political interests with the celestial heights of the \u201cbeautiful soul\u201d sought by the Romantic artist\u2019s intuition?\n  PARTICULARS: Evaluation based on active participation in class, written assignments, oral presentations and a final research paper.\n ", "topic": "Latin American Romanticisms", "schedule": [{"time": "11:00am - 11:50am", "days": "MWF", "instructor": "Feldman, Hernan"}], "notes": "", "ger": ""}, {"name": "SPAN460-002: Topic:Mod Latin Amer Studies", "Textbooks, Articles, and Resources": "none", "Grading": "none", "notes": "", "credit": "3", "opus_number": "5964", "Descriptions": "CONTENT: The contemporary metropolitan capital holds a remarkable prominence in the Latin American imaginary and the aesthetic representations of its urban landscapes are the portrait of a fragmented, contradictory, and ever-evolving definition of modernity. This course will focus on aesthetic representations of urban life (e.g. literature, sports, visual arts, and music) to trace the cultural resonance of the idea of the city and what it can tell us about the specific sociopolitical challenges shared by cities in twentieth- and twenty first-century Latin America. Our goal will be to move beyond the touristic approach to understanding the city to inquire instead about the intricate relations between urban spaces, their artistic representations, and the development of perceived notions of identity. We will consider the reconstitution of the city not as a homogeneous space of knowledge \u2013as conceived by the modern project\u2013 but rather as a chaotic ensemble: a fragmentary space that is constantly reshaped by cultural and discursive practices \u2013as presented in contemporary aesthetic accounts of the urban. \nMexico City, Bogota, Rio de Janeiro, and Buenos Aires will provide the case studies to discuss how the metropolitan capital has been shaped by massive growth, urban migration, uneven development and the tension between the global and the local and how these political and socio-economic changes have been registered in artistic discourses. We will read elite representations of the city against accounts by the marginalized masses and discuss how the urban space is imagined in this disjuncture.\n  Key questions that will guide class discussions include: How are citizenship and the public sphere defined by cultural practices? What are the imaginaries of the city that prevail in artistic accounts of the urban? What can literary and other artistic practices tell us about social practices in the city? Can urban violence be a motor for aesthetic practices? What happens to these accounts of the city with the arrival of globalization?  The course will not attempt to supply comprehensive answers to these inquiries; alternatively, students will be exposed to key concepts and discussions and will then be encouraged to relate their own interests to the subject of aesthetic representations of the Latin American city and may, if they so choose, do their final projects \u2013which may include a creative component\u2013 on topics related to the arts, sports, or urban lifestyles.", "ger": "", "schedule": [{"time": "1:00pm - 2:15pm", "days": "MW", "instructor": "Salazar, Sergio"}], "Related Courses": "none", "topic": "Imagining Lat.

Other nuns were less famous, but still leave us fascinating poems describing their joy at leaving their wifely duties and embracing the spiritual life. Laywomen also became prominent disciples, including courtesans, queens, and ordinary women and girls. Many stories about women come down to us, and these stories provide the starting point for our course.\n  Our primarily goal in this course will be to learn necessary skills for research in the humanities through an investigation of women in Buddhism throughout the ages. Comparing ancient texts with contemporary narratives, students will learn how to discern appropriate sources to construct arguments to be presented in written and oral forms. We will also spend time discussing methods for reading and note-taking, library resources and databases, approaches to writing and rewriting, seminar participation and oral presentation skills.
